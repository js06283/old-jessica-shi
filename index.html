        In summer 2021, I was a Software Engineering Intern at the United States Census Bureau as part of the Civic Digital Fellows Program of Coding it Forward. The project I worked on was part of the Criminal Justice Administrative Records System (CJARS) which is a “nationally integrated repository of data following individuals through the criminal justice system”.  I worked with a partner on creating a fully-automated production system for statistical reporting on the data repository. I was selected elected from a competitive applicant pool of 1,700+ students with an acceptance rate of 6% and engaged in the civic tech community through virtual site visits, one-on-one mentorship, and professional development.

        Since January 2021, I have been a research intern at the Complex Resilient Intelligent Systems Laboratory, led by Professor Venkat Venkatasubramanian of the Chemical Engineering Department at Columbia University. My project is on the Schelling model of segregation, which is a mathematical model developed by the economist Thomas Schelling to analyze segregation behavior. My responsibilities include reading papers, attending weekly meetings, programming computer simulations, performing mathematical analysis, and writing reports. Our research group has been working on writing a paper for publication titled “Statistical Teleodynamics Analysis of Emergent Equilibria in the Schelling Game”.

        In summer 2020, I participated in Columbia's Summer Design Challenge where I co-founded StudBud with 3 other fellow Columbia students. Our goal was to create a tool to help improve social interactions in a world shaped by COVID-19 within our campus. What we created is a platform that matches students to study groups based on their study habits and preferences. In fall semester, we were endorsed by the engineering student council and received over 1200 sign-ups for our service. As the Director of Engineering, I was responsible for creating the matching algorithm and automating many of the processes that went into our service.

		Since April 2020, I have been a Student Ambassador for Wolfram Research. I represent Wolfram Research at my school and help promote their technology stack at my university. My role is to organize events like classes and workshops and work on projects/create content for the broader community. In Spring 2021, I hosted a 3-day workshop series introducing Wolfram Language to 50+ Columbia University students and faculty. In July 2020, I also served as a Wolfram High School Summer Camp Teaching Assistant where I facilitated technical programming projects and coordinated virtual social activities for 40 high school students.

		<span class=subtitle>Detecting Gerrymandering Through Visualization and Analysis</span>
		<span class=date>09/2019-12/2019</span>
      <span>
		 This project produces an algorithm that uses a completely random method to group vertices in a graph into continuous districts. Using the redistricted map, we perform various calculations that can quantitatively measure gerrymandering, such as Reock score and efficiency gap. With larger amounts of data, we use outlier analysis to attempt to detect intent in redistricting plans within our randomly generated data set.

      <span>
		In this project, agent-based modeling was used in a computer simulation to show the dynamical change and interaction of  the cows and the grass in different paddock situations and rotation periods over time. This simulation incorporates an explicit spatial structure, unlike previous models, and was created in NetLogo, a computer programming language that creates multi-agent environment and allows the user to interact with its interface.

		<span class=date>09/2019-01/2020</span>
      <span>
		This project investigates the effect of phage titer and pattern of phage introduction on the elimination of bacteria and biofilm in a controlled environment. A mathematical model of the interaction of phages, bacteria, and biofilm is constructed in NetLogo, a computer programming language for agent-based modeling, and data is pro- duced and analyzed in Wolfram Mathematica. It was concluded that a specific pattern and titer would optimize the elimination of bacteria and biofilm.
